# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The project is a template, so the current focus is on providing a solid foundation for building fullstack Next.js applications. Use Bun for package management and Drizzle ORM for database management.

## Immediate Goals (for a user of the template)

- Clone the repository.
- Install dependencies using Bun.
- Configure environment variables (`.env`) for authentication and database connection.
- Generate and migrate the database schema.
- Run the development server.

## Tasks in Progress

- Setting up the development environment.
- Integrating authentication providers (Google, Github, Discord).
- Configuring the database connection and ORM.
