    content: `
      <p>React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components by allowing us to use state and other React features without writing a class. This guide will take you through the most commonly used hooks and best practices.</p>
      <h3>useState</h3>
      <p>The <code>useState</code> hook lets you add React state to function components. It returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}</code></pre>
      <h3>useEffect</h3>
      <p>The <code>useEffect</code> hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It replaces lifecycle methods like <code>componentDidMount</code> and <code>componentDidUpdate</code>.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">useEffect(() => {
  // Code to run on mount
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code
  };
}, []);</code></pre>
      <h3>Custom Hooks</h3>
      <p>Create your own hooks to extract component logic into reusable functions.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  return { count, increment };
}</code></pre>

      <h3>Key Accessibility Principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Perceivable:</strong> Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</li>

        <li><strong>Understandable:</strong> Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</li>
        <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</li>
      </ul>

    excerpt: 'A detailed comparison of CSS Grid and Flexbox, helping you decide the best layout approach for your web projects.',
    content: `
      <p>CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout modules that have transformed how we build responsive web designs. While both are excellent for arranging elements, they excel in different scenarios.</p>
      <h3>Flexbox for One-Dimensional Layouts</h3>
      <p>Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, meaning it can arrange items in a single row or a single column. It's perfect for distributing space among items in an interface and aligning them.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-css">.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}</code></pre>
      <h3>CSS Grid for Two-Dimensional Layouts</h3>
      <p>CSS Grid, on the other hand, is built for two-dimensional layouts. It allows you to define rows and columns simultaneously, making it ideal for complex page structures, such as a main content area with sidebars and headers/footers.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-css">.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  gap: 20px;
}</code></pre>
      <p>In summary, use Flexbox when you need to control the layout of items within a single row or column, and use CSS Grid when you need to define a grid-based layout for an entire page or a significant section of it.</p>

      <h3>Image Optimization</h3>
      <p>Images often account for a significant portion of page weight. Optimize images by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Compressing them without losing quality.</li>
        <li>Using modern formats like WebP.</li>
        <li>Serving responsive images with <code>srcset</code>.</li>
        <li>Lazy loading images that are not immediately visible.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Minify CSS and JavaScript</h3>
      <p>Minification removes unnecessary characters from code (like whitespace and comments) without changing its functionality, reducing file sizes and speeding up load times.</p>
      <h3>Leverage Browser Caching</h3>
      <p>Configure HTTP caching to instruct browsers to store static assets locally. This reduces the number of requests to your server for repeat visitors.</p>
      <h3>Reduce Server Response Time</h3>
      <p>Optimize your backend code, database queries, and server configuration to ensure quick response times. Using a CDN can also help by serving content from servers closer to your users.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Managing state in React applications can become complex as applications grow. Redux and React Context API are two popular solutions, each with its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
      <h3>Redux</h3>
      <p>Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It centralizes your application's state and logic, making it easier to understand and debug. Redux is often preferred for large, complex applications with many interacting components.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Redux example (simplified)
const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}</code></pre>
      <h3>React Context API</h3>
      <p>The Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's ideal for sharing "global" data like themes, user authentication status, or preferred language.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Context API example (simplified)
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>

      <p>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data. For web developers, this means running application logic and serving content from locations geographically nearer to the end-users.</p>
      <p>The primary benefits of edge computing include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduced Latency:</strong> By processing data closer to the user, the time it takes for data to travel to and from a central server is significantly reduced, leading to faster response times.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Lower latency translates to a snappier user experience, especially for interactive applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Reliability:</strong> Distributing computation across multiple edge locations can improve fault tolerance and ensure continuous service even if a central server experiences issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Bandwidth Usage:</strong> Processing data at the edge can reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent to a central cloud, saving bandwidth costs.</li>

    content: `
      <p>Responsive design is essential for ensuring your website looks and functions well on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens. Tailwind CSS makes building responsive designs incredibly efficient with its utility-first approach.</p>
      <p>Tailwind CSS uses a mobile-first breakpoint system. By default, all utility classes apply to mobile devices first, and then you can add responsive prefixes to target larger screens.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-html"><div class="text-center md:text-left lg:text-right">
  This text will be centered on small screens, left-aligned on medium screens, and right-aligned on large screens.
</div></code></pre>

    content: `
      <p>Beyond the basics of type safety, TypeScript offers powerful advanced features and patterns that can help you write more robust, maintainable, and scalable applications.</p>
      <h3>Generics</h3>
      <p>Generics allow you to write reusable code that works with a variety of types, rather than a single one. This is particularly useful for functions, classes, and interfaces.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-typescript">function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

let output = identity<string>("myString"); // type of output is string</code></pre>
      <h3>Utility Types</h3>
      <p>TypeScript provides several utility types to facilitate common type transformations. Examples include <code>Partial<T></code> (makes all properties in T optional), <code>Readonly<T></code> (makes all properties in T readonly), and <code>Pick<T, K></code> (constructs a type by picking the set of properties K from T).</p>
      <h3>Conditional Types</h3>
      <p>Conditional types allow you to express non-uniform type mappings based on a condition. They are often used with generics to create highly flexible types.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-typescript">type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;
// NonNullable<string | null> is string</code></pre>
      <p>Mastering these advanced patterns can significantly improve the quality and flexibility of your TypeScript codebase.</p>
